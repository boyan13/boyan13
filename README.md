I'm a third year IT student who enjoys learning for the sake of learning. I'm currently focusing on Python and C++ development, while also learning some game design. My passion for learning is not limited to programming though. I've also taken courses in Ancient Egyptian language, 20-th century art, and religion. I also enjoy psychology, philosophy, mathematics, physics and any STEM field in general.

Skills: Python / C++ / Java / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a small Python ciphering app that should help me work on designing project architectures, applying design patterns, managing a gui, and  writing clean and *pythonic* code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# (and .NET) and trying to put more time into C++. I've also picked up Blender again.
