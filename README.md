### Hello.
#### My name's Boyan, I'm a cs major and a software developer (among other things) and I'm passionate about all forms of knowledge. In my free time I usually play games, work on personal projects, or read. I think we live in a complex and endlessly curious world and am always open to exploring new things, regardless of whether they have anything to do with programming and tech.

* I have experience with C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JS (no NodeJS), MySQL, SPARQL, Git, SVN, Jupyter Notebooks, minimal experience with cmd batch files and bash

* I have experience with the following IDEs and TEs: PyCharm, VisualStudio, VSCode, Sublime TE, Notepad++, Eclipse, vi  

### Game development (level design + programming)
* I have extensive experience with Source Engine's hammer world editor - Check out my award winning map on the Garry's Mod workshop (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1092251956) and am part of the https://psr.digital/ developement group.
* I have minimal experience with Unreal Engine and Blender and a bunch of coding projects with Python's pygame, arcade, and curses modules, and C++'s SDL library. I've also tried OpenGL so I know how to set it up, but all I did is draw a triangle so...

### Currently exploring
* I am currently learning Qiskit and quantum computation in general.
* Also trying to get into Machine Learning.
