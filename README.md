### Hi,
##### I'm Boyan, nice to meet you! I'm a cs major and a software developer (among other things), currently employed at Antelope Audio. At my current job I work predominantly with Python and handle things like UI/UX integrations with hardware devices through HID and TB, maintenance and implementation of proprietary communication protocols, library development, and more. My unviersity work currently focuses on data science and machine learning (specifically support vector machines and quantum computation using qiskit).

My knowledge stack includes:

---

### Languages
* Profficient (C2) English
* Upper Intermediate (B2) Spanish
* Native Bulgarian 

### Software Development
* Main language: Python. Experience with the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, sympy, PyQt5/6, wxPyhton, curses, jupyter, Pillow, bs4, requests, sqlalchemy, django, sqlite
* Other languages: C++, Java, Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS (no NodeJS)), basic Lua, working knowledge of Bash, Powershell, Windows Command Line (CMD) 
* Database tools: MySQL, SPARQL, SQLite
* Version control tools: SVN, TortoiseSVN / Git, GitLab, GitHub 
* Experience working on Windows, Ubuntu, MacOS, as well as the virtualization tools VirtrualBox, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL, WSL2)
* Other experience: Jupyrter Notebooks and IPython, Jenkins, LaTeX

### Game development (level design + programming)
* Extensive experience with Source Engine (mostly on the level design side through the hammer world editor). Also contributed to active mods of the game.
* Some beginner experience with Unreal Engine 5 and Blender.
* A bunch of coding projects with Python's pygame, arcade, and curses modules, as well as C++ with SDL. Basic understanding of OpenGL (not a lot of experience though).

### Currently exploring
* Quantum computation (with Qiskit) and quantum advantage in the areas of machine learning (right now looking at quantum kernels).
* Machine learning, classification and pattern recognition. Right now exploring Support Vector Machines.
