### Hello.
#### My name's Boyan, I like software engineering and am passionate about all forms of STEM. In my free time I usually play games, work on personal projects, or read. I think we live in a complex and endlessly curious world and am always open to exploring new things, regardless of whether they have anything to do with programming or tech.
