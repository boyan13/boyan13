I'm a third year IT student who enjoys learning for the sake of learning. I'm currently focusing on Python and C++ development, while also learning some game design. My passion for learning is not limited to programming though. I've also taken courses in Ancient Egyptian language, 20-th century art, and religion. I also enjoy psychology, philosophy, mathematics, physics and any STEM field in general.
